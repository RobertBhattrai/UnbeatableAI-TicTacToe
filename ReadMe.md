    cd ai-tic-tac-toe
    ```

2. **Run the script:**
    ```bash
    python ai_tic_tac_toe.py
    ```

3. **Start playing:**
    - You are `X` and AI is `O`.
    - Enter a number between 0-8 as your move:

      ```
      0 | 1 | 2
      ---------
      3 | 4 | 5
      ---------
      6 | 7 | 8
      ```

## 🎮 Gameplay Example
Welcome to Tic-Tac-Toe! You are 'X'. AI is 'O'.
|   |   |   |
|   |   |   |
|   |   |   |

Enter your move (0-8): 0
| X |   |   |
|   |   |   |
|   |   |   |

AI is thinking...
| X |   |   |
|   | O |   |
|   |   |   |
